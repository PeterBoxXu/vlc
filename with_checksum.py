# In simple.py, we wasted too much time on string operations, during which the VLC devices are flickering and the messages are not sent properly.
# In this snippet, we use a checksum to verify the integrity of the message.
# The checksum is calculated using the MD5 algorithm, which is a cryptographic hash function.
# The checksum is appended to the message, separated by a pipe character.
# The receiver calculates the checksum of the message and compares it with the checksum received.
# If the checksums are the same, the message is printed.
# If the checksums are different, a NACK signal is sent to the sender.
# The sender, upon receiving a NACK signal, resends the last message.
# This way, we can guarantee that the final printed message is always correct.
# 
# Note: the checksum is calculated at application level, not at the VLC level.
